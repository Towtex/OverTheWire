# Bandit Walkthroughs

Bandit is a beginner-level wargame hosted on the OverTheWire website. It is designed to teach players the basics of Linux command-line and security techniques. The game consists of 34 levels, each with a different password that must be obtained by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system.

To play the game, players must log in to a virtual machine using SSH and navigate through the levels by finding the password for each level and using it to access the next one. The game starts with very simple challenges, such as logging in with a default username and password, and gradually introduces more complex challenges, such as finding hidden files, decoding encoded data, and exploiting vulnerabilities in programs.

The Bandit wargame is an excellent way for beginners to gain hands-on experience with Linux command-line and security techniques. The challenges are designed to be educational, and the solutions are often straightforward once the player has learned the necessary techniques.
