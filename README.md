[OverTheWire Wargames Walkthroughs](https://overthewire.org/wargames)
=====

This repository contains my solutions for wargames hosted on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames), a collection of wargames that help you learn about various aspects of cybersecurity. The wargames on the website cover topics such as Linux command-line tools, web application security, binary exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, and network security.

The wargames included in this repository are:

1. [Bandit](Bandit)
2. ...
3. ...

Currently, only the Bandit wargame has been solved, and the walkthroughs for that wargame are included in this repository. I will be updating this repository as I progress through the wargames.

Project Structure
-----

Each wargame contains several levels, with increasing difficulty. For each level, there are two files: a **levelX.md** file containing the problem description and a **levelX-solution.md** file containing the solution. In addition to the markdown files, each wargame folder may contain additional files such as scripts or binaries that are used in the walkthroughs.
